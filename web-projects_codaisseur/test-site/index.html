            <h2><u>Who? What? Why?</u></h2>
            <p>Once upon a time there was a woman who was about to begin her journey at the Royal Institute of Technology as a masters student
                of Molecular Techniques in Life Science. The summer before, she realized that wasn't going to make her happy. 
                She decided to turn down the spot. For the first time in a long time, that woman didn't know what the future had in hold for her. 
                The following spring, she quit her job and went on an "Eat Pray Love" trip to Bali. She promised herself to go away and not come back 
                until she had figured out what made her happy. That woman is me. Now she is on a new journey - to Eat Pray Code.
